layout: activity-lecture.hbs

= Activity

Create a set of components with work together to create a _Carousel_ which we can use to display different images in rotation.

ifndef::ebook[]

Like so:

image::./images/activity_example.gif[]

endif::ebook[]

We also want the carousel delay between rotations to be configurable.

The markup for our carousel will look like so:

[source,html]
----
<carousel [delay]="2000">
  <carousel-item>
    <img src="https://unsplash.it/200?image=0" alt="">
  </carousel-item>
  <carousel-item>
    <img src="https://unsplash.it/200?image=100" alt="">
  </carousel-item>
  <carousel-item>
    <img src="https://unsplash.it/200?image=200" alt="">
  </carousel-item>
</carousel>
----

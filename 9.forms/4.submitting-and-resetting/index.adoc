= Submitting & Resetting

== Learning Objectives

* How to call a function on our component when the user clicks submit.
* How to reset the form back to it's original state.

== Submitting

To submit a form in Angular we need a button with a `type` of `submit` in our form markup in between the `<form> ... </form>` tags, like so:

[source,html]
----
<form>
  .
  .
  .
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" >Submit</button>
</form>
----

When we press this submit button this triggers the normal HTML5 form submission mechanism, so it tries to _POST_ the form to the current URL.

However instead of issuing a standard POST we want to call a function on our component instead, to do that we use the `ngSubmit` directive and add it to the form element, like so:

[source,html]
----
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  .
  .
  .
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" >Submit</button>
</form>
----

This _hijacks_ the normal form submission mechanism and instead calls the function `onSubmit()` on our component. Let's implement `onSubmit()` with a simple console.log line like so:

[source,typescript]
.script.ts
----
onSubmit() {
  if (this.myform.valid) {
    console.log("Form Submitted!");
  }
}
----

Now when we press the _Submit_ button `Form Submitted!` gets printed to the console.

[TIP]
=====
We can do anything we want in this function.


To get the current value of the form model we can call `myform.value`.


In a later section we cover how to make HTTP requests, after learning that we will be able to make an API request passing in values from our form model.
=====

== Resetting

In a model driven form to _reset_ the form we just need to call the function `reset()` on our `myform` model.

For our sample form lets reset the form in the `onSubmit()` function, like so:

[source,typescript]
.script.ts
----
onSubmit() {
  if (this.myform.valid) {
    console.log("Form Submitted!");
    this.myform.reset();
  }
}
----

The form now resets, all the input fields go back to their initial state and any `valid`, `touched` or `dirty` properties are also reset to their starting values.

== Summary

We can bind to the _ngSubmit_ directives output event to call a function on our component when the user submits a form.

Calling the `reset` function on a form model resets the form back to it's original pristine state.

We can call functions on our component to process a form. However Angular gives us _another_ way to process a forms values, by using reactive programming and RxJS, we'll cover that in the next lecture.

= Overview

In this chapter we will cover both the _template driven_ and _model driven_ approach to creating forms in Angular.

We are going to create a signup form with a first name, last name, email, password and language select box.

We'll be using the twitter bootstrap UI framework so the HTML markup and classes will match the layout and styles needed for bootstrap.

We will add _visual feedback_ to the users so they know if the individual form fields contain valid values or not. If they are invalid we'll also show the user helpful validation error messages so they can fix their inputs.

Although the template driven approach is simpler, behind the scenes it's actually the model driven approach with the models automatically creating for you.

So we'll first explain the model driven approach, then the template driven approach and finally we'll show a method of implementing a _reactive model driven form_ with RxJS.

Create a custom _rollover_ image directive which shows one image normally and another when the user hovers over it.

ifndef::ebook[]
image::./images/activity-example.gif[]
endif::ebook[]

The directive will be used like so:

[source,html]
----
<img [ccRollover]="{
  'initial':'https://unsplash.it/200/300?image=201',
  'over':'https://unsplash.it/200/300?image=202'
}"/>

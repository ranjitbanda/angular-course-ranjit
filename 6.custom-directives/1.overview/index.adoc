By this point you should be able to create your own custom component as well as use a set of _built-in_ Angular directives.

Now it's time to learn how to build your own _custom_ directives.

But you might be surprised to hear that you've _already_ created a custom directive. That's because _Components are Directives_.

Components have all the features of Directives but also have a view, that is to say they have a template and some HTML that is injected into the DOM when we use it.

Another difference is that a single HTML element can only have a _single component_ associated with it. However a single element can have _multiple directives_ associated with it.

Lets continue with our joke example app and create a directive which shows the punchline of the joke when the user hovers over the card.

In this section you will learn:

* How to create custom directives using the `@Directive` decorator.
* How directives can both listen to events and change properties of the host element they are associated with.
* How we can configure a directive so that it can take `inputs` when it's defined on an element, like `[aDirective]={config:'value'}`

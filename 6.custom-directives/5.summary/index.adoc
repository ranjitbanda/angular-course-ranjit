= Wrapping Up

In this section we covered how to create a custom directive.

We learned:

* That components _are_ directives, but directives with views and templates.
* How to define a directive with the `@Directive` decorator.
* How to listen to the output events and bind to the input properties of a host element from within a directive.
* How to configure a directive to make it more re-usable.

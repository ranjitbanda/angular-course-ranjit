= Wrapping Up

Reactive programming is about conceptualising our application as _streams_ and _operations_ that are performed on those streams.

_Observables_ are a blueprint for creating streams and _plumbing_ them together with _operators_ to create _observable chains_.

RxJS is a library that lets us create and work with observables.

Angular has a few public facing APIs that use Observables, the EventEmitter, Forms and HTTP.

You are not forced to use observables in Angular, you can use as much RxJS or as little as you want.

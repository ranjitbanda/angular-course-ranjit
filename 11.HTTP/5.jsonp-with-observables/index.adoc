= JSONP Example with Observables

== Learning Objectives

* Know what JSONP is and how it overcomes CORS.
* Know how to make JSONP requests in Angular.

== What is JSONP?

JSONP is a method of performing API requests which go around the issue of _CORS_.

This is a security measure implemented in all browsers that stops you from using an API in a potentially unsolicited way and most APIs, including the iTunes API, are protected by it.

Because of CORS if we tried to make a request to the iTunes API url with the http client library the browser would issue a _CORS_ error.

The explanation is deep and complex but a quick summary is that unless an API sets certain headers in the response a browser will reject the response, the iTune API we use _doesn't_ set those headers so by default any response gets rejected.

So far in this section we've solved this by installing a chrome plugin which intercepts the response and adds the needed headers _tricking_ the browser into thinking everything is ok but it's not a solution you can use if you want to release you app to the public.

If we switch _off_ the plugin and try our application again we get this error in the console

----
XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=love&media=music&limit=20. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://run.plnkr.co' is therefore not allowed access.
----

`JSONP` is a solution to this problem, it treats the API as if it was a _javascript file_. It dynamically adds `https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=love&media=music&limit=20` as if it were a `script` tag in our our HTML like so:

[source,html]
----
<script src="https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=love&media=music&limit=20"></script>
----

The browser then just downloads the javascript file and since browsers don't check for CORS when downloading javascript files it a works around the issue of CORS.

Imagine the response from the server was `{hello:'world'}`, we don't just want to download the file because:

1. The browser would download the json and try to _execute_ it, since json isn't javascript _nothing_ would actually happen.
2. We want to do something with the json once it's downloaded, ideally call a function passing it the json data.

So APIs that support JSONP return something that looks like javascript, for example it might return something like so:

[source,javascript]
----
process_response({hello:'world'});
----

When the file is downloaded it's executed as if it was javascript and calls a function called `process_response` passing in the json data from the API.

Of course we need a function called `process_response` ready and waiting in our application so it can be called but if we are using a framework that supports JSONP these details are handled for us.

That's is JSONP in a nutshell.

1. We treat the API as a javascript file.
2. The API wraps the JSON response in a function who's name we define.
3. When the browser downloads the _fake_ API script it runs it, it calls the function passing it the JSON data.

We can only use JSONP when:

1. The API itself supports JSONP. It needs to return the JSON response wrapped in a function and it usually lets us pass in the function name we want it to use as one of the query params.
2. We can only use it for GET requests, it doesn't work for PUT/POST/DELETE and so on.

== Refactor to JSONP

Now we know a little bit about JSONP and since the iTunes API supports JSONP lets refactor our observable application to one that uses JSONP instead.

For the most part the functionality is the same as our `Http` example but we use another client lib called `Jsonp` and the providers for our `Jsonp` solution is in the `JsonpModule`.

So firstly lets import and the new `JsonpModule` and replace all instances of `Http` with `Jsonp`.

[source,typescript]
----
import {JsonpModule, Jsonp, Response} from '@angular/http';
.
.
.
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    FormsModule,
    JsonpModule # <1>
  ],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
  providers: [SearchService]
})
class AppModule { }
----
<1>  Add `JsonpModule` to the module imports.

Then lets change our `SearchService` to use the `Jsonp` library instead of `Http`, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
@Injectable()
export class SearchService {
  apiRoot: string = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search';

  constructor(private jsonp: Jsonp) { # <1>
  }

  search(term: string) {
    let apiURL = `${this.apiRoot}?term=${term}&media=music&limit=20&callback=JSONP_CALLBACK`; # <2>
    return this.jsonp.request(apiURL)  # <3>
        .map(res => {
          return res.json().results.map(item => {
            return new SearchItem(
                item.trackName,
                item.artistName,
                item.trackViewUrl,
                item.artworkUrl30,
                item.artistId
            );
          });
        });
  }
}
----
<1>  We injected `Jsonp` into the constructor and stored it on a property called `jsonp`.
<2>  We changed our apiURL by adding in `callback=JSONP_CALLBACK`.
<3>  We call `jsonp.request(...)` instead of `http.get(...)`

[IMPORTANT]
====
The iTunes API supports JSONP, we just need to tell it what name to use via the callback query parameter.
 +
 +
We passed it the special string `JSONP_CALLBACK`.
 +
 +
Angular will replace `JSONP_CALLBACK` with an automatically generated function name every time we make a  request
====

That's it, the rest of the code is exactly the same and the application works like before.

IMPORTANT: Remember if you installed the CORS plugin or added some other work around then you can switch them off, you don't need them any more.

== Summary

JSONP is a common solution in the web world to get around the issue of CORS.

We can only use JSONP with APIs that support JSONP.

To use JSONP in Angular we use the `Jsonp` client lib which is configured by importing the `JsonpModule` and adding it to our `NgModule` imports.

We make a JSONP request by calling the `request` function, it still returns an `Observable` so for the rest of your application that fact you are using `Jsonp` instead of `Http` should be invisible.

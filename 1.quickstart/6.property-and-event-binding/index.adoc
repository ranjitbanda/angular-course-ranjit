= Property & Event Binding

Our goal in this lecture is to hide the punchline of our jokes and only reveal them when the user clicks a button.

== Learning Outcomes

* How to use the _hidden_ DOM property to hide/show elements.
* Difference between DOM properties and HTML attributes.
* How to perform input property binding with `[]`
* How to perform output event binding with `()`

== Hiding and showing elements

We can hide any element by adding an _attribute_ called `hidden` to the element in HTML, so we could hide the punchline like so:

[source,html]
----
<p class="card-text" hidden>{{joke.punchline}}</p>
----

This is a core feature of HTML, not some functionality provided by Angular.

We want to add the `hidden` property to the element by default and then remove it when the user clicks a button.

So we add the following markup:

[source,html]
----
<p class="card-text" [hidden]="true">{{joke.punchline}}</p>
----

Specifically we added the markup `[hidden]="true"` and again it works, the element is hidden.

A few things:

1. We wrapped the attribute with a `[]`, more on that later.
2. We made the attribute equal to `true`, if we made it equal to `false` it shows the element.

We say we have bound the value `true` to the property called `hidden`.

IMPORTANT: This is called *Input Property Binding* and it's a very important concept in Angular.

== HTML Attribute vs DOM Property

The distinction between an HTML attribute and a DOM property is important in understanding binding in Angular.

HTML is a set of written instructions for _how_ to display a web page.

The browser reads the HTML and creates something called a _DOM_, a _Document Object Model_. This is the manifestation of those HTML instructions in memory.

Changing the HTML doesn't automatically update the webpage unless the user refreshes the browser, changing the DOM however instantly updates the webpage.

There is mostly a 1-to-1 mapping between the names and values of HTML attributes and their equivalent DOM properties, but not always.

The hidden HTML attribute is a good example, it only needs to `exist` on an HTML element to instruct the browser to hide the element.

So `hidden="true"` hides the element but confusingly so does `hidden="false"` in HTML we just need to add `hidden` to hide the element.

The DOM representation of the `hidden` attribute is a property also called `hidden`, which if set to `true` hides the element and `false` shows the element.

Angular doesn't manipulate HTML attributes, it manipulates DOM properties because the _DOM_ is what actually gets displayed.

So when we write `[hidden]` we are manipulating the _DOM property_ and not the _HTML attribute_.

This is why the above is called Input _Property_ Binding and not Input Attribute Binding.

== Input Property Binding

Looking back at our use of the hidden property:

[source,html]
----
<p class="card-text" [hidden]="true">{{joke.punchline}}</p>
----

The _target_ inside `[]` is the name of the property. In the example above the target is the `hidden` DOM property.

The _text_ to the right of `=` is javascript code that gets executed and the resulting value is assigned to the target. 


TIP: `true` is still javascript code which if executed returns `true`.


So in summary, we are binding to the DOM property `hidden` and setting it to `true` so the element is hidden.

TIP: In other parts of the web you'll see this referred to as just _property binding_. However to distinguish it from the other type of binding in Angular I like to call this *input* property binding.

We can only use this type of binding to change the value of the target. We can't use it to get _notified_ when the target's value changes, to do that we need to use something called _Output Event Binding_, more on that soon.

Let's add a property called `hide` on each joke and set it to `true`, like so:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    setup: "What did the cheese say when it looked in the mirror?",
    punchline: "Hello-Me (Halloumi)",
    hide: true
  },
  {
    setup: "What kind of cheese do you use to disguise a small horse?",
    punchline: "Mask-a-pony (Mascarpone)",
    hide: true
  },
  {
    setup: "A kid threw a lump of cheddar at me",
    punchline: "I thought ‘That’s not very mature’",
    hide: true
  },
]
----

Now we can set the hidden input property to `joke.hide` in the template, like so:

[source,html]
----
<div class="card card-block"
     *ngFor="let joke of jokes">
  <h4 class="card-title">{{joke.setup}}</h4>
  <p class="card-text"
     [hidden]="joke.hide">{{joke.punchline}}</p>
</div>
----

== Output Event Binding

We want to show or hide the punchline when a user clicks a button, so lets add a button with the label _Tell Me_ to the bottom of each card, like so:

[source,html]
----
<div class="card card-block"
     *ngFor="let joke of jokes">
  <h4 class="card-title">{{joke.setup}}</h4>
  <p class="card-text"
     [hidden]="joke.hide">{{joke.punchline}}</p>
  <a class="btn btn-primary">Tell Me</a>
</div>
----

We want to set `joke.hide` to `false` when the user clicks the button, and then back to `true` again when they click the button a second time.

To have Angular call some code every time someone clicks on the button we add some special markup to our button:

[source,html]
----
<a class="btn btn-primary"
   (click)="joke.hide = !joke.hide">Tell Me
</a>
----

We have some new syntax with `()`. The _target_ inside the `()` is an event we want to listen for, we are listening for the click event.

The _text_ to the right of `=` is some javascript which will be called every time a click event occurs.

`joke.hide = !joke.hide` toggles the value of `joke.hide`, so if it's false clicking the button will change it to true, if it's true clicking it will change it to false.

We can just as easily make the expression to the right of `=` call a function on our component instead, like so:

[source,html]
----
<a class="btn btn-primary"
   (click)="toggle(joke)">Tell Me
</a>
----

Now when the button gets clicked it calls the `toggle(...)` function on the `JokeListComponent` and passes it the joke object the card is bound to, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
toggle(joke) {
  joke.hide = !joke.hide;
}
----

Now when we click the button, we set the show property to true which then _unhides_ the element.

== Summary

The way to think about these two different ways of binding is in terms of inputs and outputs.

* With the `[]` we are binding to an input of a Component.
* With the `()` we are binding to an output of a Component.

This is what we call _one-way data binding_, since data only flows one way, either into or out of a component. 

It is possible to _simulate_ two-way data binding in Angular and we'll cover that in a later section on Forms.

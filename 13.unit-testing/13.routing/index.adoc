= Testing Routing

== Learning Objectives

* Understand how to configure the ATB in order to test routing.
* Understand how to write test specs that involve routing.

== Test setup

To test routing we need a few components and a route configuration:

[source,typescript]
----
import {Component} from "@angular/core";
import {Routes} from "@angular/router";

@Component({
  template: `Search`
})
export class SearchComponent {
}

@Component({
  template: `Home`
})
export class HomeComponent {
}

@Component({
  template: `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`
})
export class AppComponent {
}

export const routes: Routes = [
  {path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full'},
  {path: 'home', component: HomeComponent},
  {path: 'search', component: SearchComponent}
];
----

We create three components `HomeComponent`, `SearchComponent` and an `AppComponent` with a `<router-outlet>`.

We also create a route configuration where `''` redirects you to `home` and `home` and `search` show their respective components.

Our basic test suite looks like so:

[source,typescript]
----
import {Location} from "@angular/common";
import {TestBed, fakeAsync, tick} from '@angular/core/testing';
import {RouterTestingModule} from "@angular/router/testing";
import {Router} from "@angular/router";

import {
    HomeComponent,
    SearchComponent,
    AppComponent,
    routes
} from "./router"

describe('Router: App', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ # <1>
        HomeComponent,
        SearchComponent,
        AppComponent
      ]
    });
  });
});
----
<1> We import and declare our components in the test bed configuration.

== Router setup

Normally to setup routing in an Angular application we import the `RouterModule` and _provide_ the routes to the `NgModule` with  `RouterModule.withRoutes(routes)`.

However when testing routing we use the `RouterTestingModule` instead. This modules sets up the router with a _spy_ implementation of the _Location Strategy_ that doesn't actually change the URL.

We also need to get the injected `Router` and `Location` so we can use them in the test specs.

Our test suite file now looks like:

[source,typescript]
----
describe('Router: App', () => {

  let location: Location;
  let router: Router;
  let fixture;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [RouterTestingModule.withRoutes(routes)], # <1>
      declarations: [
        HomeComponent,
        SearchComponent,
        AppComponent
      ]
    });

    router = TestBed.get(Router); # <2>
    location = TestBed.get(Location); # <3>

    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent); # <4>
    router.initialNavigation(); # <5>
  });
});
----
<1> We import our `RouterTestingModule` with our routes.
<2> We grab a reference to the injected `Router`.
<3> We grab a reference to the injected `Location`.
<4> We ask the test bed to create an instance of our root `AppComponent`. We don't need this reference in our test specs but we do need to create the root component with the `router-outlet` so the router has somewhere to insert components.
<5> This sets up the location change listener and performs the initial navigation.


We are now ready to create our test specs.

== Testing routing

In our configuration we've set it so if you land on the root _empty_ url you will be redirected to `/home`, lets add a test spec for this:

[source,typescript]
----
it('navigate to "" redirects you to /home', fakeAsync(() => { # <1>
  router.navigate(['']); # <2>
  tick(); # <3>
  expect(location.path()).toBe('/home'); # <4>
}));
----
<1> Routing is an asynchronous activity so we use one of the asynchronous testing methods at our disposal, in this case the `fakeAsync` method.
<2> We trigger the router to navigate to the empty path.
<3> We wait for all pending promises to be resolved.
<4> We can then inspect the _path_ our application should be at with `location.path()`

Lets also add a test spec for navigating to the search route, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
it('navigate to "search" takes you to /search', fakeAsync(() => {
  router.navigate(['search']);
  tick();
  expect(location.path()).toBe('/search');
}));
----

The spec is exactly the same as the previous one, our link params array is different since we are triggering a different route and our expectation is again different, but the rest is the same.

== Summary

We can test routing in Angular by using `RouterTestingModule` instead of `RouterModule` to provide our routes.

This uses a _spy_ implementation of `Location` which doesn't trigger a request for a new URL but does let us know the target URL which we can use in our test specs.

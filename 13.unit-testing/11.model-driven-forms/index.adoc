= Testing Model Driven Forms

== Learning Objectives

* How to setup the TestBed in order to work with forms.
* How to create test specs that test form validity.
* How to test form submission.

== Test setup

To test forms we'll extend the `LoginComponent` we've been working with so far in this section. However we'll convert the simple email, password field form into a model driven form and we'll drop the input `enabled` property.

[source,typescript]
----
@Component({
  selector: 'app-login',
  template: `
<form (ngSubmit)="login()" # <1>
      [formGroup]="form"> # <2>
  <label>Email</label>
  <input type="email"
         formControlName="email"> # <3>
  <label>Password</label>
  <input type="password"
         formControlName="password"> # <3>
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
`
})
export class LoginComponent {
  @Output() loggedIn = new EventEmitter<User>();
  form: FormGroup;

  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {
  }

  ngOnInit() { # <4>
    this.form = this.fb.group({
      email: ['', [
        Validators.required,
        Validators.pattern("[^ @]*@[^ @]*")]],
      password: ['', [
        Validators.required,
        Validators.minLength(8)]],
    });
  }

  login() {
    console.log(`Login ${this.form.value}`);
    if (this.form.valid) {
      this.loggedIn.emit(
          new User(
              this.form.value.email,
              this.form.value.password
          )
      );
    }
  }
}
----
<1> When the user submits the form we call  the `login()` function.
<2> We associate this template  form element with the model `form` on our component.
<3> We link specific template form controls to `FormControls` on our `form` model.
<4> We initialise our `form` model in the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook.

The rest of the `LoginComponent` looks the same as before.

Our test suite looks mostly the same but has a few key differences:

[source,typescript]
----
describe('Component: Login', () => {

  let component: LoginComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<LoginComponent>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [ReactiveFormsModule, FormsModule], # <1>
      declarations: [LoginComponent]
    });

    // create component and test fixture
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(LoginComponent);

    // get test component from the fixture
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    component.ngOnInit(); # <2>
  });
});
----
<1> We add the required `ReactiveFormsModule` and `FormsModule` to our test beds imports list.
<2> We manually trigger the `ngOnInit` lifecycle function on our component, Angular won't call this for us.

Now lets look at how we can test our forms validity.

== Form validity

The first test spec we may want to check is that a blank form is invalid. Since we are using model driven forms we can just check the `valid` property on the form model itself, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
it('form invalid when empty', () => {
  expect(component.form.valid).toBeFalsy();
});
----

We can easily check to see if the form is _valid_ by checking the value of `component.form.valid`.

[TIP]
====
This one of the reasons model driven forms are easier to test than template driven forms, we already have an object on the component we can inspect from our test spec for _correctness_.
 +
 +
With template driven forms the state is in the _view_ and unless the component has a reference to the template form with a `ViewChild` decorator there is no way to test the form using a unit test. We would have to perform a full E2E test simulating button clicks and typing in values into forms.
====

== Field validity

We can also check to see if individual fields are valid, for example the email field should initially be invalid.

[source,typescript]
----
it('email field validity', () => {
  let email = component.form.controls['email']; # <1>
  expect(email.valid).toBeFalsy(); # <2>
});
----
<1> We grab a reference to the actual field itself from the `form.controls` property.
<2> Just like the form we can check if the field is valid through `email.valid`.

=== Field errors

As well as checking to see if the field is valid we can also see what specific validators are failing through the `email.errors` property.

Since it's required and the email field hasn't been set I would expect the requrired validator to be failing, we can test for this like so:

[source,typescript]
----
  it('email field validity', () => {
    let errors = {};
    let email = component.form.controls['email'];
    errors = email.errors || {};
    expect(errors['required']).toBeTruthy(); # <1>
  });
----
<1> Because `errors` contains a key of `required` and this has a _value_ this means the required validator is _failing_ as we expect.


We can set some data on our input control by calling `setValue(...)` like so:

[source,typescript]
----
email.setValue("test");
----

If we did set the email field to be `test` this should fail the pattern validator, since that expects the email to contain a `@`. We can then check to see if the pattern validator is failing like so:

[source,typescript]
----
email.setValue("test");
errors = email.errors || {};
expect(errors['pattern']).toBeTruthy();
----

== Submitting a form

We can submit a form by clicking on the submit button, but we've already covered this in a previous lecture.

Since the `ngSubmit` directive has it's own set of tests it's safe to _assume_ that the `(ngSubmit)=login()` expression is working as expected.

So to test form submission with model driven forms we can just call the `login()` function on our controller, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
component.login();
----

Since our form emits an event from the `loggedIn` output event property we can use the same method we covered in the section on testing components to test this form submission. Namely subscribe to the observable and store a reference to the emitted event for later comparison, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
  it('submitting a form emits a user', () => {
    expect(component.form.valid).toBeFalsy();
    component.form.controls['email'].setValue("test@test.com");
    component.form.controls['password'].setValue("123456789");
    expect(component.form.valid).toBeTruthy();

    let user: User;
    // Subscribe to the Observable and store the user in a local variable.
    component.loggedIn.subscribe((value) => user = value);

    // Trigger the login function
    component.login();

    // Now we can check to make sure the emitted value is correct
    expect(user.email).toBe("test@test.com");
    expect(user.password).toBe("123456789");
  });
----

== Summary

We can easily unit test model driven forms in Angular by just testing the form model itself.

To test template driven forms in Angular we need to launch a full end to end testing environment and interact with a browser to test the form.

Next we will take a look at how to test an applications that makes http requests.

= Testing Http

== Learning Objectives

* How to configure a test suite so we can mock the Http service to send back fake responses.

== Test setup

To demonstrate how to test http requests we will add a test for our iTunes `SearchService` which we created in the section on Http.

We will use the promise version of the search service that uses JSONP to get around the issue of CORS.

[source,typescript]
----
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {Jsonp} from '@angular/http';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise';

class SearchItem {
  constructor(public name: string,
              public artist: string,
              public thumbnail: string,
              public artistId: string) {
  }
}

@Injectable()
export class SearchService {
  apiRoot: string = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search';
  results: SearchItem[];

  constructor(private jsonp: Jsonp) {
    this.results = [];
  }

  search(term: string) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.results = [];
      let apiURL = `${this.apiRoot}?term=${term}&media=music&limit=20&callback=JSONP_CALLBACK`;
      this.jsonp.request(apiURL)
          .toPromise()
          .then(
              res => { // Success
                this.results = res.json().results.map(item => {
                  console.log(item);
                  return new SearchItem(
                      item.trackName,
                      item.artistName,
                      item.artworkUrl60,
                      item.artistId
                  );
                });
                resolve(this.results);
              },
              msg => { // Error
                reject(msg);
              }
          );
    });
  }
}
----

NOTE: Although we are using JSONP here, testing Http and Jsonp is exactly the same. We just replace instances of `Jsonp` with `Http`.

=== Configuring the test suite

We want the `Jsonp` and `Http` services to use the `MockBackend` instead of the _real_ `Backend`, this is the underling code that actually sends and handles http.

By using the `MockBackend` we can intercept real requests and simulate responses with test data.

The configuration is slightly more complex since we are using a _factory provider_:

[source,typescript]
----
{
  provide: Http, # <1>
  useFactory: (backend, options) => new Http(backend, options), # <2>
  deps: [MockBackend, BaseRequestOptions] # <3>
}
----
<1> We are configuring a dependency for the token `Http`.
<2> The injector calls this function in order to return a new instance of the `Http` class. The arguments to the `useFactory` function are themselves _injected_ in, see (3).
<3> We define the dependencies to our `useFactory` function via the `deps` property.

For our API however we are using `Jsonp`, we can just replace all mention of `Http` with `Jsonp` like so:

[source,typescript]
----
{
  provide: Jsonp,
  useFactory: (backend, options) => new Jsonp(backend, options),
  deps: [MockBackend, BaseRequestOptions]
}
----

The above configuration ensures that the `Jsonp` service is constructed using the `MockBackend` so we can control it later on in testing.

Together with the other providers and modules we need our initial test suite file looks like so:

[source,typescript]
----
describe('Service: Search', () => {

  let service: SearchService;
  let backend: MockBackend;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      imports: [JsonpModule],
      providers: [
        SearchService,
        MockBackend,
        BaseRequestOptions,
        {
          provide: Jsonp,
          useFactory: (backend, options) => new Jsonp(backend, options),
          deps: [MockBackend, BaseRequestOptions]
        }
      ]
    });

    backend = TestBed.get(MockBackend); # <1>

    service = TestBed.get(SearchService); # <2>
  });
});
----
<1> We grab a reference to the _mock backend_ so we can control the http responses from our test specs.
<2> We grab a reference to the `SearchService`, this has been created using the `MockBackend` above.

== Using the `MockBackend` to simulate a response

Just by using the `MockBackend` instead of the real `Backend` we have stopped the tests from triggering real http requests from being sent out.

Now we need to configure the `MockBackend` to return dummy test data instead, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
it('search should return SearchItems', fakeAsync(() => {
  let response = { # <1>
    "resultCount": 1,
    "results": [
      {
        "artistId": 78500,
        "artistName": "U2",
        "trackName": "Beautiful Day",
        "artworkUrl60": "image.jpg",
      }]
  };

  backend.connections.subscribe(connection => { # <2>
    connection.mockRespond(new Response(<ResponseOptions>{ # <3>
      body: JSON.stringify(response)
    }));
  });
}));
----
<1> We create some fake data we want the API to response with.
<2> The mock backend `connections` property is an observable that emits an `connection` every time an API request is made.
<3> For every connection that is requested we tell it to `mockRespond` with our dummy data.

The above code returns the same dummy data for _every_ API request, regardless of the URL.

== Testing the response

Using HTTP is asynchronous so in order to test we need to use one of the asynchronous testing methods, we'll use the `fakeAsync` method.

[source,typescript]
----
it('search should return SearchItems', fakeAsync(() => { # <1>
  let response = {
    "resultCount": 1,
    "results": [
      {
        "artistId": 78500,
        "artistName": "U2",
        "trackName": "Beautiful Day",
        "artworkUrl60": "image.jpg",
      }]
  };

  // When the request subscribes for results on a connection, return a fake response
  backend.connections.subscribe(connection => {
    connection.mockRespond(new Response(<ResponseOptions>{
      body: JSON.stringify(response)
    }));
  });

  // Perform a request and make sure we get the response we expect
  service.search("U2"); # <2>
  tick(); # <3>

  expect(service.results.length).toBe(1); # <4>
  expect(service.results[0].artist).toBe("U2");
  expect(service.results[0].name).toBe("Beautiful Day");
  expect(service.results[0].thumbnail).toBe("image.jpg");
  expect(service.results[0].artistId).toBe(78500);
}));
----
<1> We use the `fakeAsync` method to execute in the special _fake async zone_ and track pending promises.
<2> We make the _asynchronous_ call to `service.search(...)`
<3> We issue a `tick()` which blocks execution and waits for all the pending promises to be resolved.
<4> We now _know_ that the service has received and parsed the response so we can write some expectations.

== Summary

We can test code that makes Http requests by using a `MockBackend`.

This requires that we configure our `TestBed` so that the `Jsonp` or `Http` services are created using the `MockBackend`.

We grab a reference to the instance of `MockBackend` that was injected and use it to simulate responses.

Since _Http_ is asynchronous we use of one of the _async_ testing mechanisms so we can write tests specs for our code.

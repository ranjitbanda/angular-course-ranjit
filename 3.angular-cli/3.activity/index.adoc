. Follow the instructions in the previous lectures and on the Angular CLI repository https://github.com/angular/angular-cli[site] to install the Angular CLI on your computer.

. Create a project locally on your computer.

. Mirror the functionality of the Joke application in the blitz below in your Angular CLI powered project.

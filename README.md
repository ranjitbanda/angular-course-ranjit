This is the official repository for the Angular course on https://angular.codecraft.tv

- Each folder is a chapter in the book, ordered by prefix number
- Each chapter has a subfolder for each lecture, again ordered by prefix number
- Each lecture as an index.adoc file which contains the content for that lecture.
- Each lecture folder also contains a `code` and `images` folder which contains code and/or images needed to support that lecture.

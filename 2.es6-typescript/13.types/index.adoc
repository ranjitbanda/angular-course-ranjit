== Transpile-time type checking

WARNING: The video mentions using the `typings` tool to install 3rd party type definitions. This has been depreciated since `TypeScript` version 2.0 in favour of the `@types` npm packages, see the end of this lecture for information on using `@types`. 

Some of the most common mistakes we make while writing JavaScript code is to misspell a property or a method name.

We only find out about the mistake when we get a _runtime error_, that is to say when we are running our application. 

NOTE: This is why testing is so important for javascript applications, only _running_ them can surface errors.

Other languages like C++ or Java have something called _type checking_, during a compilation phase it first checks for some simple mistakes in the code and raises an error if it finds any.

TypeScripts transpilation mechanism also performs _type checking_, however it only works when we tell TypeScript the _type_ of things.

e.g. in javascript we might write:

[source,typescript]
----
let a;
a = 1;
a = '2';
----

We expected the type of the `a` variable to remain a number over its life. But by mistake we assigned a string `&#39;2&#39;` to `a`, this doesn't cause an error in JavaScript.

Only if one of the functions which depends on `a` starts misbehaving do we even get a clue that something might be wrong.

However with typescript we can clearly state that we want the `a` variable to always hold a number, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let a: number = 1;
----

Then if somewhere else in our code we wrote:

[source,typescript]
----
a = "1";
----

We get this error:

[source]
----
error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
----

If we take advantage of types in typescript the transpiler will warn us with a transpile-time errors.

== Supported Types

=== Basic Types

We can support boolean, number and string.

[source,typescript]
----
let decimal: number = 6;
let done: boolean = false;
let color: string = "blue";
----

=== Arrays

We have two ways of describing the types of arrays.

The first is to use the brackets notation `[]`, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
----

The above indicates to TypeScript that this array should only hold numbers.

The second way uses a generic type specifically `Array&lt;Type&gt;`, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let list: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
----

NOTE: We cover _generics_ in more detail later on in this lecture.

=== Functions

We can describe a variable as one that will only point to a function, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let fun: Function = () => console.log("Hello");
----

With TypeScript we can also define the _expected return type_ of a function, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
function returnNumber(): number {
  return 1;
}
----

The above lets TypeScript know that the function should only return a number.

=== Enum

An Enum is a datatype consisting of a set of named values. The names are usually identifiers that behave as constants. Enums were introduced in ES6.

[source]
----
enum Direction {
    Up,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right
}

let go: Direction;
go = Direction.Up;
----

=== Class &amp; Interface

Classes and Interfaces, whether created by you or others, are also types of things. So we can use them where we would use any of the built-in types:

[source,typescript]
----
class Person {};
let person: Person;
let people: Person[];
----

=== Any

If we don't know the type of something we can fall back to using `any`.

If used it doesn't provide any type checking but does make it clear that we intentionally _don't know_ the type, rather than we forgot to add the type.

[source,typescript]
----
let notsure: any = 1;
notsure = "hello"; // This is fine since we don't do type checking with any
----

=== Void

`void` means no type, it's typically used to indicate that a function will not return anything at all, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
function returnNothing(): void {
  console.log("Moo");
}
----

=== Type Assertion

Sometimes we end up in a situation where we know more than TypeScript about the type of something. In those situations we can use _type assertions_ as a hint to the transpiler about the type of something, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let value: any = "Asim Hussain";
let length: number = (<string>value).length;
----

`(&lt;string&gt;value)` lets TypeScript know that we believe the type of value to be string.

== Generics

How can we create re-usable bits of code which can still take advantage of typescripts transpile-time type checking?

Take for instance this example:

[source,typescript]
----
class Audio {}
class Video {}
class Link {}
class Text {}

class Post {
    content: any;
}
----

We have a class called Post which has a `content` property. The content might be an instance of Audio, Video, Link or Text classes.

We could ignore the type of content and just use `any` like the example above but this doesn't give us the benefit of type checking.

We can create seperate `AudioPost`, `VideoPost`, `LinkPost` and `TextPost` types, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
class AudioPost {
    content: Audio;
}

class VideoPost {
    content: Video;
}

class LinkPost {
    content: Link;
}

class TextPost {
    content: Text;
}
----

But apart from being verbose and time-consuming it assumes we know all the content types upfront. Maybe a consumer later on would like to create a `VRPost` type.

With _generics_ we can dynamically generate a new type by passing into the Post type a _type variable_, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
class Audio {}
class Video {}
class Link {}
class Text {}

class Post<T> {
    content: any;
}
----

`&lt;T&gt;` above is the _generic_ syntax and `T` is the _type variable_. We could name it anything but the convention if there is only one is to call it just `T`.

Then we can use `T` wherever we would use a type, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
class Post<T> {
    content: T;
}
----

Finally when we want to create a specific type of Post we can declare it like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let videoPost: Post<Video>;
----

== Optional Types

By default we don't _have_ to add types when using TypeScript, we could just leave them out.

[source,typescript]
----
let answer;
answer = 42;
----

TypeScript won't perform any type checking for the above and assumes a type of `any`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This behaviour is controlled by the `noImplicitAny` flag in `tsconfig.json`. If set to `false` then TypeScript assumes `any` for missing types, of set to `true` then TypeScript throws an error if no type is present.
 +
 +
Opinion is split as to whether to keep this to `true` or `false`, by default it's set to `false` which is more forgiving but then doesn't force developers to use types which is the point of TypeScript.
====

== Type Inference.

If a variable is _declared and initialised on one line_ TypeScript will try to infer, _guess_, the type of a variable by how it's declared, for example:

[source,typescript]
----
let answer = 42;
answer = "42";
----

TypeScript inferred that the type of answer was number by the fact we initialised it with a number. When we later on try to assign a string to `answer` it throws an error.

[source]
----
error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
----

== Types for external libraries

This is all fine for code that's written in TypeScript and has types.

What if you wanted to use code that wasn't written in TypeScript or which you are not going to include as TypeScript and compile yourself.

We can use something called an _ambient type definition_.

This is a file that contains meta-data about the types in another library, a _meta-type_ file.

This repository (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped[https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped]) contains type definitions for some of the most popular 3rd party javascript libraries.

To use them in a file we simply:-

. Download the associated type file, for example `jquery.d.ts`.
. In the typescript file where we want to _use_ the 3rd party library, add this to the top of the file:
[source]
----
/// <reference path="jquery.d.ts" />
----

=== @types

Thats a bit cumbersome so since TypeScript version 2.0 we can use the `@types` npm packages instead.

All the type definitions are now available in the npm scope `@types`. Which means if the types exist we can install it like so::

[source]
----
npm install --save @types/angular
----

The above are the type defintions for AngularJS (Angular version 1.x). 

If you were to import `angular` into your project like so:

[source]
----
import * as angular from "angular";
----

Then even though AngularJS was written in JavaScript without type information, the extra type information in @types/angular is enough for TypeScript to treat it as if it was written in TypeScript and give you type errors etc...

== Summary

With transpile-time type checking TypeScript can help uncover bugs much earlier and faster than if they were to manifest at run-time.

Using types is optional but highly recommended by the Angular team.

If using 3rd party libraries that have already been transpiled into javascript, typescript can still perform transpile-time type checking if we include the type definition file for the library.

= Wrapping Up

In this section we covered the basics of ES6 JavaScript and TypeScript.

We discussed how TypeScript is a super-set of ES6 JavaScript.

We explained how to install the command line tools so you can transpile TypeScript locally on your computer.

We covered the core features of ES6 such as `let`, `const`, template strings, fat arrow functions; `for-of` loops, Map and Set; as well as how to deal with asynchronous programming by using Promises. 

With TypeScript we covered classes, class access modifiers, interfaces; decorators, modules and types including generic types.

We've covered a lot of topics but still this is just the _essentials_ required to build Angular applications, there is more to learn in each of these areas.

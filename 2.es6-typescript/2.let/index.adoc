= Let

== Block Scope

A confusing point for developers coming from different languages is the way variable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)[scope] behaves in JavaScript.

TIP: _Scope_ refers to the lifecycle of a variable, i.e. where in the code it's visible and for how long.

In Java and C++ there is the concept of block scope, a block is any code that is wrapped in `{` and `}`, like so:

[source]
----
{
    // This is a block
}
// This is not part a block
----

This means that in those languages if you declare a variable inside a block, it's only visible inside that block and any nested blocks inside that block. 

But in ES5 JavaScript we only have two scopes, the _global scope_ and _function scope_.

So if I wrote:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  var a = "block";
}
console.log(a);
----

Those coming from Java or C++ backgrounds might think that this would throw an error because we are trying to use the variable `a` outside of the block it was created in. But in JavaScript it doesn't, this code is perfectly legal.

The variable `a`, as we've declared it above, exists in _global scope_ so this means it's visible from _everywhere_ in our application.

In ES5 apart from global scope, the only other scope is _function scope_, so if we wrote.

[source,javascript]
----
function hello() {
    var a = "function";
}
hello();
console.log(a);
----

If we ran the above we would get an error, like so:

[source]
----
Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined(â€¦)
----

This is because the `a` variable is declared _inside_ a function and is therefore only visible inside _that_ function, trying to access it outside the function results in an error.

But again this isn't _block level scope_ as we can see if we add a _for loop_ inside the function, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
function hello() {
    var a = "function";
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        var a = "block";
    }
    console.log(a);
}
hello();
----

What gets printed out here is `block` not `function` despite the fact we are outside the for loop, that's because the body of the for loop is not its own scope.

=== IIFE

This issue of _no block level scope_ has plagued JavaScript developers since its inception.

One common workaround in the past has been to use something called an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) like so:

[source,javascript]
----
function hello() {
    var a = "function";

    for (var i=0; i<5; i++) {
        (function() {
            var a = "block";
        })();
    }
    console.log(a);
}
hello();
----

This now prints out `function`.

If this syntax looks a bit strange to you:

[source,javascript]
----
(function() {
    var a = "block";
})();
----

Know its just a shorter way of writing:

[source,javascript]
----
function something() {
  var a = "block";
}
something();
----

It's a function that we call _immediately_ after defining it.

Since functions have their own scope, using an IIFE has the same effect as if we had block level scope, the variable `a` inside the IIFE isn't visible _outside_ the IIFE.

== Let

IIFEs work but it's a pretty long winded way of solving this problem. So with ES6 we now have the new `let` keyword, we use it in place of the `var` keyword and it creates a variable *with* block level scope, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
function hello() {
    var a = "function";
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        let a = "block";
    }
    console.log(a);
}
hello();
----

Now the `a` declared in the for loop body only exists between the `{` and `}`, and the code snippet above prints out `function` as expected.

== Using let in for loops

So a classic interview question to test JavaScript developers knowledge of the lack of block level scope is this one:

[source,javascript]
----
var funcs = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
    var y = i;
    funcs.push(function () {
        console.log(y);
    })
}
funcs.forEach(function (func) {
    func()
});
----

What gets printed out?

You might expect 

[source]
----
0
1
2
3
4
----

But in fact it's

[source]
----
4
4
4
4
4
----

The reason for this is that the variable `y` is not _block level_, it doesn't _only_ exist inside its enclosing `{}`
In fact it's a global variable and by the time any of the functions are called it's already been set to 4.

In the above example if we replace `var y = i` with `let y = i` then the variable `y` only exists inside it's block, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
var funcs = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
    let y = i;
    funcs.push(function () {
        console.log(y);
    })
}
funcs.forEach(function (func) {
    func()
});
----

And so executing this now results in:

[source]
----
0
1
2
3
4
----

== The for loop short-cut

The above construct is so common we have a shortcut, we can declare the index variable `i` with `let` in the for loop expression, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
var funcs = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
    funcs.push(function () {
        console.log(i);
    })
}
funcs.forEach(function (func) {
    func()
});
----

Even though `let i = 0` is strictly declared _outside_ of the for block `{ }`, any variables declared in the for loop expression with `let` has block level scope in the for loop.


== Summary

`let` is a very important addition the javascript language in ES6.

It's not a replacement to `var`, `var` can still be used even in ES6 and has the same semantics as ES5.

However unless you have a specific reason to use `var` I would expect all variables you define from now on to use `let`.

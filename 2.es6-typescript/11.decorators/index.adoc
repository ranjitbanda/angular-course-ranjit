= Decorators

We've seen in the quickstart that in Angular we can _decorate_ a class with extra info using the `@` syntax, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
@Component({
	selector: "thingy",
	template: `foo`
})
class MyComponent {
}
----

This is a new feature that will _probably_ make it into the _ES7_ version of JavaScript, it's not available right now however even in the ES6 version.

However the functionality is available in TypeScript, so we can already make use it.

It allows us to _decorate_ classes and functions, similar to annotations in java and decorators in python.

Specific Angular implementations might be more complex and harder to read and understand but the concept is actually quite simple.

== Simple no-argument decorator

I'm going to explain by creating a decorator called `@course` for our Person class

[source,typescript]
----
@course
class Person {
    firstName;
    lastName;

    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
----

`@course` is just a _function_, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
function course(target) {
    Object.defineProperty(target.prototype, 'course', {value: () => "Angular 2"})
}
----

The first argument to the `course` function is the `target`. 

This is the _thing_ the decorator is attached to, so for a class it's going to be the _function constructor_ for that class, the _under-the-hood_ implementation of a class.

Knowing this we can actually dynamically add a function to our Person class by using the `Object.defineProperty` function,

The details of the `Object.defineProperty` function are beyond the scope of this chapter. We use it to add a function called `course` onto the class it decorates and for now this function just returns the string "Angular 2".

We can now call `asim.course()` and this prints out `"Angular 2"`:

[source,typescript]
----
let asim = new Person("Asim", "Hussain");
console.log(asim.course()); // Angular 2
----

== Decorators with arguments

But how do we pass arguments to our decorator, like the way the `@Component` decorator works?

We create a function that _returns_ a decorator, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
function Course(config) { // 1
  return function (target) {
    Object.defineProperty(
        target.prototype,
        'course',
        {value: () => config.course} // 2
    )
  }
}
----

. We pass a `config` object to the _outer_ `Course` function.
. Then use that `config` in the returned _inner_ decorator function.

Now we can use this decorator like so:

[source,typescript]
----
@Student({
    course: "Angular 2"
})
class Person {
}
----

== Summary

Decorators are a new feature of TypeScript and used throughout the Angular code, but they are nothing to be scared of.

With decorators we can configure and customise our classes at design time.

They are just functions that can be used to add meta-data, properties or functions to the thing they are attached to.

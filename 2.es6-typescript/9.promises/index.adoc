= Promises

When you execute a task _synchronously_, you wait for it to finish before moving on to the next line of code. 

When you execute a task _asynchronously_, the program moves to the next line of code before the task finishes.

Think of synchronous programming like waiting in line and asynchronous programming like taking a ticket. When you take a ticket you can go do other things and then be notified when ready.

== Callbacks

One way to program asynchronously is to use _callbacks_. We pass to an asynchronous function a function which it will call when the task is completed.

[source,typescript]
----
function doAsyncTask(cb) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Async Task Calling Callback");
    cb();
  }, 1000);
}

doAsyncTask(() => console.log("Callback Called"));
----

The `doAsyncTask` function when called kicks of an asynchronous task and _returns immediately_.

To get notified when the async task completes we pass to `doAsyncTask` a function which it will call when the task completes.

It's called a _callback_ function, `cb` for short, because it _calls-you-back_.

== Promise API

In ES6 we have an alternative mechanism built into the language called a _promise_. 

A _promise_ is a _placeholder_ for a future value.

It serves the same function as callbacks but has a nicer syntax and makes it easier to handle errors.

== Creating a Promise

We create an instance of a promise by calling `new` on the `Promise` class, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
var promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
});
----

We pass to Promise an inner function that takes two arguments `(resolve, reject)`.

Since we are defining the function we can call these arguments whatever we want but the convention is to call them `resolve` and `reject`. 

`resolve` and `reject` are in fact functions themselves.

Inside this inner function we perform our asynchronous processing and then when we are ready we call `resolve()`, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
var promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Async Work Complete");
    resolve();
  }, 1000);
});
----

We usually return this promise from a function, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
function doAsyncTask() {
  var promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Async Work Complete");
      resolve();
    }, 1000);
  });
  return promise;
}
----

If there was an error in the async task then we call the `reject()` function like so:

[source,typescript]
----
function doAsyncTask() {
  var promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Async Work Complete");
      if (error) {
        reject();
      } else {
        resolve();  
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
  return promise;
}
----

== Promise Notifications

We can get notified when a promise `resolves` by attaching a _success_ handler to its `then` function, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
doAsyncTask().then(() => console.log("Task Complete!"));
----

`then` can take two arguments, the second argument is a _error_ handler that gets called if the promise is `rejected`, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
doAsyncTask().then(
  () => console.log("Task Complete!"),
  () => console.log("Task Errored!"),
);
----

Any values we pass to the `resolve` and `reject` functions are passed along to the _error_ and _success_ handlers, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let error = true;
function doAsyncTask() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (error) {
        reject('error'); // pass values
      } else {
        resolve('done'); // pass values
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

doAsyncTask().then(
  (val) => console.log(val),
  (err) => console.error(err)
);
----

== Immediate Resolution or Rejection

We can create an immediately _resolved_ Promise by using the `Promise.resolve()` method, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let promise = Promise.resolve('done');  
----

And an immediately _rejected_ Promise by using the `Promise.reject()` method, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let promise = Promise.reject('fail');  
----

One of the nice things about Promises is that if we add a `then` handler *after* the promise resolves or rejects the handler *still* gets called. 

[source,typescript]
----
let promise = Promise.resolve('done');  
promise.then((val) => console.log(val)); // 'done'
----

In the above example, even though the Promise has resolved _before_ we added the success handler, the promise framework still calls the success handler.

== Chaining

We can also connect a series of `then` handlers together in a chain, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
Promise.resolve("done")
  .then(
    (val) => {
      console.log(val);
      return 'done2';
    },
    (err) => console.error(err)
  )
  .then(
    (val) => console.log(val),
    (err) => console.error(err)
  );
// 'done'
// 'done2'
----

Promises pass an error along the chain till it finds an error handler. So we don't need to define an error handler for each `then` function, we can just add one at the end like so:

[source,typescript]
----
Promise.reject('fail')
  .then((val) => console.log(val))
  .then(
    (val) => console.log(val),
    (err) => console.error(err)
  );
----

If we throw an exception from our promise function or one of the success handlers, the promise gets rejected and the error handler is called, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
Promise.resolve('done')
  .then((val) => {
    throw new Error("fail")
  })
  .then(
    (val) => console.log(val),
    (err) => console.error(err)
  );
// [Error: fail]
----

== Catch

The `catch` function works exactly the same way as the `then` error handler, it's just clearer and more explicitly describes our intent to handle errors.

[source,typescript]
----
Promise.resolve('done')
  .then((val) => {throw new Error("fail")})
  .then((val) => console.log(val))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
----

== Summary

Promises are a far cleaner solution to writing asynchronous code than callbacks.

The resulting code that's created is easier to read and is often written the order the application will execute.

So it can be easier to trace through code in your head.

With the `catch` handler it also gives us a single place where we can handle errors.

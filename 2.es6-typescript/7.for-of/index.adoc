= For Of

In this lecture we are going to examine how we can loop over arrays, using the methods available to us in the past with ES5 and also the new `for-of` looping mechanism in ES6.

== For &amp; ForEach

We have a couple of ways of looping through Arrays in ES5 javascript.

For one we have the classic `for` loop, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let array = [1,2,3];
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
----

With ES5 JavaScript we can also use the `forEach` method on the Array class, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let array = [1,2,3];
array.forEach(function (value) {
  console.log(value);
});
// 1
// 2
// 3
----

It's slightly shorter but has a few downsides:

. You can’t break out of this loop using a `break` statement or move to the next iteration with `continue`.
. You can't return from the enclosing function using a `return` statement.

== For In

The `for-in` loop is designed for iterating over an _objects properties_, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
var obj = {a:1,b:2};
for (let prop in obj) {
    console.log(prop);
}
// a
// b
----

If we tried to use it with an array, it might initially look like it's working:

[source,typescript]
----
let array = [10,20,30];
for (let index in array) {
  console.log(index);
});
// 0
// 1
// 2
----

But if we tried to print out the type of `index` like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let array = [10,20,30];
for (let index in array) {
  console.log(typeof(index));
};
// string
// string
// string
----

The `index` variable is a _string_ and not a _number_, using `for-in` with arrays converts the index to a string.

IMPORTANT: If you are expecting a number but in fact have a string this can cause problems, for example `"1" + "2"` is the string `"12"` and not the number `3`.

== For-of loop

Rather than change the way the `for-in` loops work in ES6 and in the process create a breaking change, instead in ES6 we have a new syntax called `for-of`.

[source,typescript]
----
let array = [10,20,30];
for (var value of array) {
  console.log(value);
}
// 10
// 20
// 30
----

* This is the most concise way of looping through array elements.
* It avoids all the pitfalls of `for–in`.
* It works with `break`, `continue`, and `return`

== Summary

The `for–in` loop is for looping over object properties.

The `for–of` loop is for looping over the values in an array.

`for–of` is not just for arrays. It also works on most array-like objects including the new `Set` and `Map` types which we will cover in the next lecture.

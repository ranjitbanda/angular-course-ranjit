= Fat Arrow Functions

== Syntax

JavaScript has _first class functions_.

This means that in JavaScript functions can be themselves be passed around like any other value, even as arguments to other functions.

E.g. we can pass to the `setTimeout` function, a function, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
setTimeout(function() {
	console.log("setTimeout called!");
}, 1000);
----

The function we pass as an argument to `setTimeout` is called an _anonymous function_ because it doesn't have a name.

ES6 has introduced a slightly different syntax to define anonymous functions called the _fat arrow_ syntax, with it we can re-write the above as:

[source,typescript]
----
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("setTimeout called!")
}, 1000);
----

If the function only contains one expression we can drop the braces and shorten even further to:

[source,typescript]
----
setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout called!"), 1000);
----

== Arguments

What if we wanted to pass an argument to the function?

We can re-write the below normal function to one that uses the fat arrow syntax:

[source,typescript]
----
let add = function(a,b) {
	return a + b;
};
----

Can now be written as:

[source,typescript]
----
let add = (a,b) => a + b;
----

TIP: In the first example we write `return a + b` but in the _fat arrow_ version we just wrote `a + b`. That's because in the fat arrow syntax if it is on one line, the statement gets returned automatically without the need to use the `return` keyword.

== this

Lets imagine we have an `object` with a function called `sayLater`, like so:

[source,typecript]
----
let obj = {
	name: "asim",
	sayLater: function() {
		console.log(`${this.name}`);
	}
};
obj.sayLater();
----

In the `sayLater` function `this` points to `obj`

So `console.log(`${this.name}`);` prints out `asim`. 

Now lets imagine that we log the message using the `setTimeout` function.

[source,typescript]
----
let obj = {
    name: "asim",
    sayLater: function () {
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(`${this.name}`);
        }, 1000);
    }
};
obj.sayLater();
----

In the `sayLater()` function we call `setTimeout` and then log the value of `this.name`, which we expect to be _asim_.

In fact we get `undefined` printed out to the console.

=== Calling context

The reason for this is that the value of `this` in a function depends on _how_ the function is called.

At it's most basic level if the function is called as `obj.sayLater()`, the value of `this` is the calling context which in this case is `obj`.

What is the calling context for the anonymous function we pass to `setTimeout`? What will `this` point to inside that function?

[source,typescript]
----
setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(`${this.name}`);
}, 1000);
----

The answer is _it depends_. 

In the browser it's either `undefined` or the `global` object depending on if you are running in strict mode or not. In node it's an internal `timeout` object.

In all cases however it _isn't_ going to be `obj`, so `this.name` is not going to return _asim_, it's going to return `undefined` or raise an error.

This _instability_ of `this` is an incredibly common problem in javascript that has affected it since the early days.

In ES5 there are a number of methods we can use to stabilise the value of `this`. One common solution is to assign `this` to another variable at the top, usually called `self` or `vm`, and then always use `self` in the function body, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let obj = {
    name: "asim",
    sayLater: function () {
        let self = this; // Assign to self
        console.log(self);
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log(`${self.name}`); // Use self not this
        }, 1000);
    }
};
----

But in ES6 we can do better, if we use _fat arrow_ functions the value of `this` inside a fat arrow function will be the same as the value of `this` _outside_ the fat arrow function.

It uses the value of `this` from the surrounding code for its context. i.e. whatever `this` points to in the surrounding code, `this` will point to in the function body of the fat arrow function.

We can re-write our obj to use fat arrow syntax like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let obj = {
    name: "asim",
    sayLater: function () {
        console.log(this); // `this` points to obj
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(this); // `this` points to obj        
            console.log(`${this.name}`); // `this` points to obj
        }, 1000);
    }
};
obj.sayLater();
----

If we ran the above code we would see that the value of `this` in the `setTimout` function is now `obj`; the same as the value of `this` outside the `setTimeout` function. 

== Summary

The new fat arrow function syntax in ES6 is far more than just a slightly shorter way of writing anonymous functions.

It has finally solved the thorny issue of stabilising the value of `this` that has affected javascript since the start and caused so many work arounds to be discussed and applied in code.

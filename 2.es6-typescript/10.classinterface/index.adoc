How do we write object orientated code in ES6?

== Object Orientation in JavaScript

JavaScript has a prototype-based, object-oriented programming model. It creates objects using other objects as blueprints and to implement inheritance it manipulates what's called a _prototype chain_.

We normally call the way object orientation is implemented in C++ or Java as the _Classical OO Pattern_ and the way it's implemented in JavaScript as the _Prototype Pattern_.

Although the prototype pattern is a valid way to implement object orientation it can be confusing for newer javascript developers or developers used to the classical pattern. 

So in ES6 we have an alternative syntax, one that closer matches the classical object orientated pattern as is seen in other languages.

TIP: Under the hood the new syntax still uses the prototype pattern with constructor functions and the prototype-chain. However, it provides a more common and convenient syntax with less boilerplate code.

NOTE: TypeScript supports the ES6 `class` syntax but also adds some other feature like access modifiers and interfaces, so in this lecture we'll be writing TypeScript rather than pure ES6.

// We'll also be coding locally instead of plunker so we can use `tsc` to transpile our typescript into javascript and we'll be using node to execute.



== Class

A `class` is a blueprint for creating objects with specific functions and properties already attached to it, lets go through a simple example line by line:

[source,typescript]
----
class Person { # <1>
    firstName = ""; # <2>
    lastName = "";
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {  # <3>
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    
    name() { # <4>
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
 
    whoAreYou() {
        return `Hi i'm ${this.name()}`; # <5>
    }
}
----
<1> We define a class using then `class` keyword.
<2> We describe the properties we want on our class instance.
<3> Each class has a special `constructor` function, this is called when we create an instance of a class with `new`
<4> We describe the functions, also known as methods, that we want on our class instance.
<5> `this` in a method points to the class instance, the object that is created using this class.

=== Class Instance

A class is a _blueprint_ for creating an object, we call that created object an _instance of a class_, or a _class instance_ or just _instance_ for short.

We instantiate a class by using the `new` keyword and when that happens javascript calls the `constructor` function. We can pass to the constructer arguments which it uses to initialise properties or call other function, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let asim = new Person("Asim","Hussain");
----

The above creates an instance of the _Person_ class called _asim_.

The _asim_ instance has the same properties and functions that are described on the Person class:

[source,typescript]
----
let asim = new Person("Asim","Hussain");
asim.whoAreYou() 
// "Hi i'm Asim Hussain"
----

= Inheritance

A class can inherit from another class. We can create a class blue-print that _extends_ an existing class blue-print by adding other methods or properties.

We do this by using the `extends` keyword, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
class Student extends Person { # <1>
    course; # <2>
    
    constructor(firstName, lastName, course) { 
        super(firstName, lastName); # <3>
        this.course = course;
    }

    whoAreYou() { 	# <4>
        return `${super.whoAreYou()} and i'm studying ${this.course}`; # <5>
    }
}
----
<1> We use the `extends` keyword to signal that this class inherits all the properties and methods from the _parent_ Person class.
<2> We can describe additional properties.
<3> We use the `super` function to call the constructor of the parent class
<4> We can _override_ member functions of the parent class with our own versions.
<5> In member functions `super` refers to the `parent` instance.

We can then instantiate this derived class like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let asim = new Student("Asim", "Hussain", "Angular 2");
console.log(asim.whoAreYou());
// Hi i'm Asim Hussain and i'm studying Angular 2
----

== Access Modifiers

Everything we have learned so far about classes is pure ES6 JavaScript.

However TypeScript adds some nice functionality on top of ES6 classes, namely function and property _visibility_ via _access modifiers_.

For example we can define the properties of our Person class as `private`, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
class Person {
    private firstName = "";
    private lastName = "";
    
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
----


And we create a function on our Student class called `test()` which tries to access one of these properties, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
class Student extends Person {
  .
  .
  .
  test() {
    console.log(this.firstName);
  }
}
----

And we tried to call this function from our `Student` instance, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let asim = new Student("Asim", "Hussain", "Angular 2");
console.log(asim.test());
----

Compiling the above with typescript prints out this error:

[source]
----
error TS2341: Property 'firstName' is private and only accessible within class 'Person'.
----

By marking the `firstName` property as `private` it is now only visible from one of the methods on `Person` class.

We can also define _class methods_ as `private` with the same effect. If we tried to call a `private` method from _outside_ of a Person class, the typescript transpiler throws an error.

There are 3 access modifiers:

public:: This is the default and means its visible everywhere.
private:: Only member functions of the class it's declared in can see this.
protected:: Only the class it's declared in and any class that _inherits_ from that class can see this.

== Constructor shortcut

A really common pattern in constructors is to use them to initialise properties via arguments you pass into the constructor, like in our example:

[source,typescript]
----
class Person {
    private firstName = "";
    private lastName = "";
    
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
}
----

As long as you are using an _access modifier_ TypeScript lets us shorten this to:

[source,typescript]
----
class Person {
    constructor(private firstName, private lastName) {
    }
}
----

== Interfaces

TypeScript has another feature called an `interface`. An interface can be used in a number of scenarios but by far the most common is when used with classes.

When used with classes the syntax looks like this:

[source,typescript]
----
class Person implements Human {
}
----

`Human` in the example above is an _interface_. An interface lets you describe the _minimum_ set of *public* facing properties or methods that a `class` has. 

Another way interfaces are explained is that they describe a set of rules the class has to follow, a _contract_ it has to adhere to.

So for us a `Human` interface might look like:

[source,typescript]
----
interface Human {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}
----

IMPORTANT: Since interfaces are all about the *public* interface of a class they can't have access modifiers, the properties above have to be _public_.

If the Person class then doesn't implement at least a `firstName` and a `lastName` then typescript throws an error like so:

[source]
----
error TS2420: Class 'Person' incorrectly implements interface 'Human'. Property 'firstName' is missing in type 'Person'.
----

Sometimes however we might want an interface to describe an optional contract. We can append `?` to the _name_ of the property or function to mark it as _optional_, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
interface Human {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
		name?: Function;
		isLate?(time: Date): Function;
}
----

== Summary

In ES6 we now have a new way of writing object oriented code with the `class` syntax.

We can inherit methods and properties of one class into another by using the `extends` keyword.

Under the hood we are still using prototype based inheritance but the syntax is easier to understand and more familiar for developers who are coming from other languages.

TypeScript adds some extra functionality on-top of ES6 classes such as _access modifiers_ and _interfaces_

= Injectors

== Learning Objectives

* Know how an injector resolves a _token_ into a _dependency_.
* Know how child injectors work.

== Creating Injectors

At the core of the DI framework is an _injector_.

An injector is passed a _token_ and returns a _dependency_ (or list of).

We say that an injector _resolves_ a token into a dependency.

Normally we never need to implement an _injector_. Angular handles low level injectable implementation details for us and typically we just configure it to give us to behaviour we want.

However to explain how injectors work we will implement some injectable code, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
import { ReflectiveInjector } from '@angular/core'; # <1>

class MandrillService {}; # <2>
class SendGridService {};

let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([  # <3>
  MandrillService,
  SendGridService
]);

let emailService = injector.get(MandrillService); # <4>
console.log(emailService);
----
<1> We import our injector class.
<2> We create two service classes, a `MandrillService` which sends email via the Mandrill platform and the `SendGridService` which sends email via the SendGrid platform.
<3> We configure our injector by providing an array of classes.
<4> We pass in a token, the class name, into our injector and ask it to _resolve_ to a dependency. In this case it simply returns an instance of `MandrillService`.


[NOTE]
====
The injector doesn't return the class, but an _instance_ of the class instantiated with `new`, like so:
[source,typescript]
----
emailService = new MandrillService()
----
====

== Dependency caching

The dependencies returned from injectors are cached. So multiple calls to the _same_ injector for the _same_ token will return the _same_ instance, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let emailService1 = injector.get(MandrillService);
let emailService2 = injector.get(MandrillService);
console.log(emailService1 === emailService2); // true
----

IMPORTANT: A _different_ injector for the _same_ token might return a _different_ instance of a dependency but the _same_ injector will always return the _same_ instance.

`emailService1` and `emailService2` point to exactly the same thing, therefore we can share _state_ between two different parts of our application by injecting the same dependency, like so:

[source,typescript]
----
let emailService1 = injector.get(MandrillService);
emailService1.foo = "moo";

let emailService2 = injector.get(MandrillService);
console.log(emailService2.foo); // moo # <1>
----
<1> Since `emailService1` and `emailService2` are the same instance, setting a property on one will mean it can be read from the other and vice versa.

== Child Injectors

Injectors can have one or more _child_ injectors. These behave just like the parent injector with a few additions.

[upperalpha]
1. Each injector creates it's own _instance_ of a dependency

[source,typescript]
----
import { ReflectiveInjector } from '@angular/core';

class EmailService {}

let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([EmailService]); # <1>
let childInjector = injector.resolveAndCreateChild([EmailService]);

console.log(injector.get(EmailService) === childInjector.get(EmailService)); // false # <2>
----
<1> The `childInjector` and parent `injector` are both configured with the same providers.
<2> The `childInjector` resolves to a different _instance_ of the dependency compared to the parent `injector`.

Both injectors are configured with the _same_ `EmailService`. They each resolved the dependency and returned different instances.


I've mentioned previously that different injectors return different instances of dependencies, this is also true even if the injector is a _child_ injector, it will still resolve to a different instance to the parent.


[upperalpha]
[start=2]
1. Child injectors forward requests to their parent injector if they can't resolve the token locally.

[source,typescript]
----
import { ReflectiveInjector } from '@angular/core';

class EmailService {}

let injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([EmailService]); # <1>
let childInjector = injector.resolveAndCreateChild([]); # <2>

console.log(injector.get(EmailService) === childInjector.get(EmailService)); // true # <3>
----
<1> We configure a parent injector with `EmailService`.
<2> We create a child injector from the parent injector, this child injector is not configured with any providers.
<3> The parent and child injectors resolve the same token and both return the _same_ instance of the dependency.

We request the token `EmailService` from the `childInjector`, it can't find that token locally so it asks it's parent injector which returns the instance it had cached from a previous direct reqeust.

Therefore the dependency returned by the child and the parent is exactly the same instance .

TIP: Don't worry if the significance of this isn't clear yet, it'll become clear in the lecture on configuring DI in Angular.


== Summary

We configure injectors with providers.

We pass to injectors a token and then resolve this into a dependancy.

Injectors cache dependancies, so multiple calls result in the same instance being returned.

Different injectors hold different caches, so resolving the same token from a different injector will return a different instance.

We create child injectors from parent injectors.

A child injector will forward a request to their parent if it can't resolve the token itself.

So far we've only covered providers that provide _classes_ providers can provide other types of dependencies which is the topic of the next lecture.

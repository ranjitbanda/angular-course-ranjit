= Wrapping Up

Directives are just components but without views.

We _attach_ directives to elements by adding them as attributes.

Angular provides a small number of built-in directives and in this section we covered all of them, including:

* `NgFor`
* `NgIf`
* `NgSwitch`
* `NgClass`
* `NgNonBindable`

In the next section we will create our own custom directives.

= Overview

We've covered Components in the last section, in this section and the next we'll cover the concept of _Directives_.

We've touched on a few directives already, such as `NgFor`.

Directives are components _without_ a view. They are components without a template. Or to put it another way, components are directives _with_ a view.

Everything you can do with a directive you can also do with a component. But not everything you can do with a component you can do with a directive.

We typically _associate_ directives to existing elements by use _attribute_ selectors, like so:

[source,html]
----
<elemenent aDirective></element>
----

[TIP]
====
We capitalise the name of directives when we are talking about the directive _class_. For example when we say `NgFor` we mean the class which defines the `NgFor` directive.
 +

When we are talking about either an _instance_ of a directive or the _attribute_ we use to associate a directive to an element we lowercase the first letter. So `ngFor` refers to both the _instance_ of a directive and the _attribut_e name used to associate a directive with an element.
====
In this section we are going to cover the built in directives that come bundled with Angular.

= Structural Directives

== Learning Objectives

* Understand what a structural directive is.
* Know why we use the `\*` character for some directives only.

== Long form structural directives

_Structural Directives_ are directives which _change_ the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.

There are three built in structural directives, `NgIf`, `NgFor` and `NgSwitch`.

These directives work by using the HTML5 `<ng-template>` tag. This is a new tag in HTML which is specifically designed to hold _template_ code. It can sit under the `body` element but any content inside it is not shown in the browser.

Using `ng-template` we can write an `ngIf` expression as:

[source,typescript]
----
<ng-template [ngIf]='condition'>
  <p>I am the content to show</p>
</ng-template>
----

If we go back to our joke app example and replace the hiding and showing of a joke with this _template_ version of `ngIf` we would end up with:

[source,typescript]
----
<ng-template [ngIf]="!data.hide">
  <p class="card-text">
  {{ data.punchline }}
  </p>
</ng-template>
----

The `NgFor` version is slightly more complex:

[source,typescript]
----
<ng-template ngFor # <1>
          let-j # <2>
          [ngForOf]="jokes"> # <3>
  <joke [joke]="j"></joke>
</ng-template>
----
<1> This is the `NgFor` directive itself.
<2> This is another way of declaring a template local reference variable, equivalent to `#j`.
<3> `[ngForOf]` is an _input property_ of the `NgFor` directive.

== Syntax sugar and `*`

So if we can write `ngIf` with `ng-template` what is al the fuss about `*`.

When we _prepend_ a directive with `*` we are telling it to use the element it's attached to _as_ the template.

Looking at the `NgIf` example from above, these two snippets of code are equivalent:

[source,typescript]
----
<ng-template [ngIf]="!data.hide">
  <p class="card-text">
    {{ data.punchline }}
  </p>
</ng-template>
----

[source,typescript]
----
<p class="card-text"
   *ngIf="!data.hide">
  {{ data.punchline }}
</p>
----

Finally looking at the more complex `NgFor` example from above, these two snippets of code are also equivalent:

[source,typescript]
----
<ng-template ngFor
          let-j
          [ngForOf]="jokes">
  <joke [joke]="j"></joke>
</ng-template>
----

[source,typescript]
----
<joke *ngFor="let j of jokes"
      [joke]="j">
</joke>
----

== Summary

Structural directives are a type of directive which changes the structure of the DOM.

We use the `<ng-template>` tag to define the element we want to insert into the DOM.

We can prepend the directive name with `*` to skip having to define a `<ng-template>` and have the directive use the element it's attached to as the template.
